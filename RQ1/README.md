## RQ1. Stockholder

### Protocols

We searched the issue tracker of VS Code with the two keywords, `update screenshot` and `outdated screenshot`. In total, we obtained 210 bug reports. From them, we randomly sample 20% of the bug reports, and select 44 bugs. These outdated-screenshot bugs are reported by 27 users and are fixed by 18 programmers.

The GitHub profiles record the organizations and programming experience of users. If no organization is explicitly listed, we examine personal websites linked from GitHub profiles, such as LinkedIn, blogs, and Twitter. If no such links are available, we use Google to search for a personal website associated with the same name and verify whether it contains information consistent with the GitHub profile. We also list our examined personal website of users on our website. Other researchers can check our results. For each user, we calculate the duration from the date of the first activity on GitHub to the date of reporting or fixing the outdated screenshot. We use the durations to measure the programming experience of users. We classify users and programmers by their organizations and programming experience. For users, the results are useful for understanding the outreach impact of outdated screenshots. For programmers, the results are useful for understanding the required expertise of checking and repairing reported outdated screenshots.

### Results
